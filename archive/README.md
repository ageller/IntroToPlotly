This is a similar, though longer, version of the notebook in the root directory.

If you cannot install Python or Plotly on your computer (or you prefer not to do so), you can use the [version on Google colab linked here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JiEgyzJWC547CmamXJWj-GGCHqRVZPC7?usp=sharing).

A live version of the final interactive, containing data up to Nov. 1, 2023, is available [here](https://ageller.github.io/IntroToPlotly/plotly_graph.html).
