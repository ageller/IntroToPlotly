# Creating Interactive Figures with Plotly + Python

Plotly is a versatile plotting package that can be used with Python to create interactive figures to explore your data in real time.  In this workshop you will learn how to create a variety of figures with Plotly.  We will explore COVID-19 data together, but I encourage you to bring your own data as well.  The workshop will be hands-on, running through a Jupyter notebook.  Some prior Python knowledge is required.  

If you would like work directly on your computer, please make sure that you have Python installed.  I recommend installing Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Then you can create and activate a new environment for this workshop by typing the following commands into your (bash) terminal.

```
conda create -n plotly-env python=3.9 jupyter pandas plotly statsmodels
conda activate plotly-env
```

This environment can alternatively be created manually in the Navigator GUI with Anaconda, if you are not comfortable working from the command line. 

If you cannot install Python or Plotly on your computer (or you prefer not to do so), you can use the [version on Google colab linked here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JiEgyzJWC547CmamXJWj-GGCHqRVZPC7?usp=sharing).

A live version of the final interactive, containing data up to Nov. 1, 2023, is available [here](https://ageller.github.io/IntroToPlotly/plotly_graph.html).
