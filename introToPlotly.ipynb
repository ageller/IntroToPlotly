    "## Why/When to use Plotly (my 2 cents)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already know Python and you don't really want to learn another coding language, but you do want to create interactive figures (e.g., within a Jupyter notebook and/or for use on a website), you should look into Plotly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, [Plotly express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) is a fantastic tool for generating quick interactive figures without much code.  Plotly express covers a good amount of ground, and you may be able to do all/most your work within Plotly express, depending on your specific needs.  In this workshop, I'll show you Plotly express, but then move beyond it for the majority of the content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Though you can do a lot with Plotly, it definitely has limitations (some of which we'll see in this workshop). Also, as with all of the ready-made interactive plot solutions (e.g., [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), [Glue](https://glueviz.org/), etc.), Plotly has a specific look, which can only be tweaked to a certain extent.  If you like the look well enough and you don't mind the limitations, then it's a good choice. "
